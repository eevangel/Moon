# TALK-ON
## (Team Assessment and Learner Knowledge Observational Network)

TALK-ON is a mixed reality test bed designed to explore questions of simulation fidelity, assessment, and feasibility involved in using consumer virtual reality technologies for armored vehicle leadership training.

The TALK-ON prototype is focused on cognitive and communication skills training of novice tank platoon leaders, who must accurately assess tactical situations, make quick decisions, and communicate effectively with the tank crew, other tanks within and across platoons, and higher command.

## Technical Lead
- Refactored and inherited development on Oculus DK2 communication trainer for tank commander students enrolled in the Armor Basic Officer Leaders Course (ABOLC). The project assesses the educational efficacy of a lower fidelity, cheaper, and portable system than the higher fidelity, extremely high cost, and massive Close Combat Tactical Trainer(CCTT)
- Developed GUI for game master for all NPCs as well as the scripted training scenario
- Created user gameplay, voice chat / recording, and gameplay assessment for research collaboration with Army Research Lab (ARL) West and ABOLC
- Updated development to newer Unity version, Vive headset with Vive Trackers, and custom peripheral for audio channel switching

- Using the Vive system, the soldier can stand up "out of the open hatch" and have full spatial awareness, so they may spot the enemy aircraft, just like in a tank. CCTT would use small displays surrounding a hatch which, limited the soldier's perspective.
- The soldier spots the enemy aircraft, hides in the tank, and communicates to his Loader (the Gamemaster IRL) to load an anti-aircraft round. Then, the soldier directs his platoon to engage with the enemy aircraft.
