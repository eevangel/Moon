So let me start from the beginning. I grew up playing video games, loved playing World Class Track Meet on the NES with my siblings and cousins, sometimes cheating at the long jump and failing miserably.

 I loved all those adventure games from the early 90's especially Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, which compelled me so much I had to complete all the game paths which led me to even make calls to the 900 number hint line.

I loved the idea of creating new experiences, creating new worlds for people to play in. I feel blessed that I grew up drawing, since it felt like the best way to express myself. And in high school, I found a knack for computer science, building a Super Knockout clone for a final project. 

So, I went to USC to explore both computer science and drawing.
There, I found that my heart was tied to visual media and fine arts and how artists can just express the human condition. And at the time, Shadow of the Colossus came out and showed me amazing atmosphere, and elegant game mechanics with colossal boss puzzles which showed me a path for video games to evoke similar artistic expressions. It felt like a new intellectual and artistic frontier. 

And so I worked at High Moon Studios on a triple A shooter/beat-em-up. I loved collaborating and brainstorming with these extremely intelligent people and learning the difference from coding in school and coding professionally which exposed to me just how much I didn’t know yet. 

While I had a lot of fun doing it,  I also realized I wanted to contribute to something educational or socially minded. And that's how I ended up at ICT. 

My first couple projects there, I worked on serious games that ignited soldiers’ awareness and developed their soft skills so they could identify situations where there could be an IED,  so we were developing games that could literally save their lives.
And on such a smaller team, I was forced to wear many hats, from developing network protocols, making build servers, using agile methodologies to set schedules and assign features, as well as interview SMEs to create project requirements. 

And then, I moved on to working at the Mixed Reality Lab where I got the chance to play with bleeding edge technologies along the XR spectrum.
We mocked up possible future naval interfaces, prototyped a prototyping system, and made a tank commander communication trainer in VR. It was a place that helped birth this current VR wave. I got to be a first hand witness to the perspectives of the people directing the industry, while working on problems at it's frontier.

While exploring the possibilities of virtual reality, I used my free time to explore the beauty of our reality. I explored my love of the ocean by becoming a surf instructor where i taught local middle and high school teams, as well as  inner city kids, some of which never saw the ocean before. And I taught them to survive wipeouts until they finally stood up on that one ride and got the biggest smile on their faces with a pod of dolphins surrounding them. 

I also collected reef data while scuba diving for Reef Check along the southern California coast and all the way over in the Maldives. The data we collected would be used to direct policies conserving marine wildlife and ecosystems.

I also started managing the West LA Burrito Project where every other Monday 12 people, ranging from high school kids to 80 year old retirees, would cram into a tiny community center kitchen, turning 2 lbs of beans, 8 lbs of ground turkey, 3 onions, 3 lbs of cheese and 1 pint of salsa into 100 burritos every other Monday and hand them out to the homeless at 3rd St. Promenade. 

And I did all this surf instruction, underwater data collection, and tons of burritos for 3 years, and met really wonderful people. 

Although I loved my life in LA, I love my girlfriend who lived in San Francisco. So when I got the opportunity to work at telltale, I went for it. I was excited to explore narrative focused game development tied to thematic gameplay. And I’ve been a great fan of theirs since The Walking Dead and the relationship they created between Clementine and Lee. And I loved collaborating with a much wider variety of disciplines. And it was great, until the company folded so suddenly. 

And now, I'm excited for the next opportunity working with the industry's best to create amazing interactive experiences that spark that same curiosity and joy I got from all those games I loved playing, all those waves I've caught for myself and others, and all those folded burritos.
